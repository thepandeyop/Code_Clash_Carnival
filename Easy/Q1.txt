Problem Statement:

Write a program that takes an integer n as input and returns a string based on the following rules:

If the number is divisible by 3, output "Fizz".
If the number is divisible by 5, output "Buzz".
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, output "FizzBuzz".
Otherwise, output the number itself as a string.

# Example 1:
Input: 3
Output: "Fizz"
Explanation: 3 is divisible by 3, so the output is "Fizz".

# Example 2:
Input: 5
Output: "Buzz"
Explanation: 5 is divisible by 5, so the output is "Buzz".

# Example 3:
Input: 15
Output: "FizzBuzz"
Explanation: 15 is divisible by both 3 and 5, so the output is "FizzBuzz".

# Example 4:
Input: 7
Output: "7"
Explanation: 7 is not divisible by 3 or 5, so the output is "7".

Input:

An integer n representing the number to be evaluated. (0 <= n <= 100)
Output:

A string representing the output based on the rules mentioned above.
