Problem Statement:-

Write a program to check if a given positive integer is a prime number or not.
 A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 
 
 For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc., are prime numbers.

Your program should take a positive integer n as input and output whether n is a prime number or not.

Input:

A positive integer n (n > 1).

Output:

"Prime" if the input integer n is a prime number.
"Not Prime" if the input integer n is not a prime number.

Example:

Input: 7
Output: Prime

Input: 12
Output: Not Prime
