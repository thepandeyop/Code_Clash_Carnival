Problem statement:-

Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome or not.

Input:

A string s consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase letters, digits, and/or special characters. 
The length of the string is at most 1000 characters.

Output:

A boolean value indicating whether the input string s is a palindrome or not.
Return True if the input string is a palindrome.
Return False if the input string is not a palindrome.

# Example 1:
Input: "radar"
Output: True
Explanation: The input string "radar" is a palindrome because it reads the same backward as forward.

# Example 2:
Input: "level"
Output: True
Explanation: The input string "level" is a palindrome because it reads the same backward as forward.

# Example 3:
Input: "hello"
Output: False
Explanation: The input string "hello" is not a palindrome because it does not read the same backward as forward.

# Example 4:
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"
Output: True
Explanation: The input string "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama" is a palindrome because it reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.
