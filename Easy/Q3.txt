Problem Statement
Write a program to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer.
 The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. 
 
 For example, 
 
 the factorial of 5 (written as 5!) is calculated as 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, which equals 120.

Your program should take a non-negative integer n as input and output its factorial.

Input:

A non-negative integer n (0 <= n <= 20).

Output:

The factorial of the input integer n.

Example:

Input: 5
Output: 120

Input: 7
Output: 5040
