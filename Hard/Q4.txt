Question:

Write a program to calculate the power of a given number raised to an exponent. 
The power of a number represents the number of times the base number is multiplied by itself.
 For example, 2 raised to the power of 3 (2^3) equals 2 * 2 * 2, which equals 8.

Your program should take two inputs: a base number base and an exponent exponent, and output the result of raising base to the power of exponent.

Input:

Two integers separated by a space:

The base number base.
The exponent exponent.
Output:

The result of raising the base number base to the power of exponent.

Example:

Input: 2 3
Output: 8

Input: 5 4
Output: 625
