Question:

Write a program to find the Nth Fibonacci number.
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.
Therefore, the sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.

Your program should take a positive integer n as input and output the Nth Fibonacci number.

Input:

A positive integer n.

Output:

The Nth Fibonacci number.

Example:

Input: 6
Output: 8

Input: 10
Output: 34
