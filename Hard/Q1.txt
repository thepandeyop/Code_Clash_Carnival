Question:

Write a program to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers. 
The GCD of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

Your program should take two positive integers a and b as input and output their greatest common divisor.

Input:

Two positive integers a and b separated by a space.

Output:

The greatest common divisor of the input integers a and b.

Example:

Input: 12 18
Output: 6

Input: 36 48
