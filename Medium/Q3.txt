Question:

An Armstrong number (also known as Narcissistic number or plenary number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its 
own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong
 number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153.

Write a program to check if a given positive integer is an Armstrong number or not.

Your program should take a positive integer n as input and output whether n is an Armstrong number or not.

Input:

A positive integer n.

Output:

"Armstrong" if the input integer n is an Armstrong number.
"Not Armstrong" if the input integer n is not an Armstrong number.

Example:

Input: 153
Output: Armstrong

Input: 9474
Output: Armstrong

Input: 123
Output: Not Armstrong
